# Transfer-learning-on-MNIST-Fasion-MNIST
Automated classification of items and numbers have always been an important topic in machine learning. 
Numerous methods have been invented to solve this problem. 
In this report, we used pre-trained model to extract useful features from the dataset first. 
Then, various techniques were employed on these extracted features to classify items. 
Two different datasets are used in this study.
1. MNIST dataset. It contains more than 60,000 training and 10,000 test 28*28 images of numbers.
2. Fashion-MNIST dataset. It contains  more than 60,000 training and 10,000 test 28*28 images of fashion apparel.
